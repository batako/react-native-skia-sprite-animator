# TODO

- [ ] Remove leftover Resume control references from docs/components if not needed.
- [ ] Delete this file once all cleanup tasks are complete.
- [ ] Allow animations to mix frames sourced from multiple sprite images.
- [ ] Update `SpriteAnimator` to support per-animation FPS + frame multipliers directly so the editor no longer needs to bake values into frame durations.
